<h3>Minimum Spanning Trees</h3>

<h4>Definition</h4>

- Input : Connected graph G = (V, E) with edge costs
- Goal : Find T $\subseteq$ E such that (V, T) is connected and total cost of all edges in T is smallest. T is then the **minimum spanning tree (MST)** of G.

Example:

<table border='0' align="center">

<h4>Applications</h4>

- Network Design
- Designing networks with minimum cost but maximum connectivity
- Approximation algorithms
- Can be used to bound the optimality of algorithms to approximate Traveling Salesman Problem, Steiner Trees,etc.
- Cluster Analysis

<h4>Basic Properties</h4>

- Tree = undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.
- Tree = a connected graph with no cycles.
- Subgraph H of G is spanning for G, if G and H have same connected components.
- A graph G is connected $\Longleftrightarrow$ it has a spanning tree.
- Every tree has a leaf (i.e., vertex of degree one).
- Every spanning tree of a graph on n nodes has n − 1 edges.

<h4> Cuts </h4>
Given a graph G = (V, E), a cut is a partition of the vertices of the graph into two sets (S, V \ S).

- Edges having an endpoint on both sides are the edges of the cut.
- A cut edge is crossing the cut.
- (S, V \ S) = {uv $\in$ E | u $\in$ S, v $\in$ V \ S}.

<h4> Safe and Unsafe edges </h4>

<h5> Safe edge </h5>

- Definition: An edge e = (u, v) is a safe edge if there is some partition of V into S and V \ S and e is the unique minimum cost edge crossing S (one end in S and the other in V \ S).
- So, every cut identifies one safe edge, the cheapest edge in the cut.
- Note that an edge e may be a safe edge for many cuts.
- For example: In the below graph, the edge marked in red is a safe edge in the cut (S, V\S)

</p>

<h5> Unsafe edge </h5>

- Definition: An edge e = (u, v) is an unsafe edge if there is some cycle C such that e is the unique maximum cost edge in C.
- So, every cycle identifies one unsafe edge, the most expensive edge in the cycle.
- Example : 

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec19/unsafe.png" alt="text" style="width: 300px;" >

- If edge costs are distinct then every edge is either safe or unsafe

<h4> Spanning tree properties </h4>

- If e is a safe edge then every minimum spanning tree contains e.
- Suppose e = (v,w) is not in MST T and e is min weight edge in cut (S, V \ S). Assume v ∈ S. Then, T' = (T \ {e'}) $\cup$ {e} is a spanning tree.
- The safe edges form the MST 
    - Let G be a connected graph with distinct edge costs, then the set of safe edges does not contain a cycle.
    - Let G be a connected graph with distinct edge costs, then set of safe edges form the unique MST of G.
- The unsafe edges are not in the MST
    - If e is an unsafe edge then no MST of G contains e. 

<h4> Algorithms </h4>

- Borůvka’s Algorithm
```latex
T is ∅ (* T will store edges of a MST *)
while T is not spanning do
    X ← ∅
    for each connected component S of T do
        add to X the cheapest edge between S and V \ S
    Add edges in X to T
return the set T
```
Running time: O(m log n) time

- Kruskals Algorithm
```latex
Kruskal_ComputeMST
    Initially E is the set of all edges in G
    T is empty (* T will store edges of a MST *)
    while E is not empty do
        choose e ∈ E of minimum cost
        if (T ∪ {e} does not have cycles)
            add e to T
    return the set T
```
Running time: O(m log m) + O(mn) = O(mn)

- Prim's Algorithm
```latex
Prim_ComputeMST
    E is the set of all edges in G
    S = {1}
    T is empty (* T will store edges of a MST *)
    while S 6= V do
        pick e = (v,w) ∈ E such that
            v ∈ S and w ∈ V \ S
            e has minimum cost
        T = T ∪ e
        S = S ∪ w
    return the set T
```
Running time: O(nm)
- Prim's Algorithm using Priority Queues
```latex
Prim_ComputeMSTv3
    T ← ∅, S ← ∅, s ← 1
    ∀v ∈ V (G) : d(v) ← ∞, p(v) ← Nil
    d(s) ← 0
    while S 6= V do
        v = arg min u∈ V\S d(u)
        T = T ∪ {vp(v)}
        S = S ∪ {v}
        for each u in Adj(v) do
            d(u) ← min {d(u), c(vu)}
            if d(u) = c(vu) then
                p(u) ← v
    return T
```
