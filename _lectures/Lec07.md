<h4>Context-Sensitive Language</h4>

<h4>Definition</h4>

 - Context-sensitive language is a higher level language when compared to Context-Free Language.
 - Context-sensitive language is a language that can be generated by some **Context Sensitive Grammar** and is a set of all languages that can be accepted by a **Linear bounded Non-deterministic Turing machine**.

<h4>Context-Sensitive Grammar</h4>

<h4>Definition</h4>

A CSG is a quadruple G = (V, T, P, S)

- V = Finite set of non-terminal symbols
- T = Finite set of terminal symbols (alphabet)
- P = Finite set of production rules
  - Each production rule is represented as $\alpha$ &rarr; $\beta$
  - Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are strings in $\(V \cup T\)^*$ 
- S = S $\in$ V is a start symbol

<h5>Example</h5>

The language L = { $a^{n} b^{n} c^{n}$ \| $n \ge 1$} is a context-sensitive language.

- V = {S,A,B}
- T = {a,b,c}
- P = {S &rarr; abc \| aAbc , Ab &rarr; bA , Ac &rarr; Bbcc , bB &rarr; Bb , aB &rarr; aa \| aaA}

<h4>Turing Machines</h4>
 
 <h5>Definition</h5>

A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm

- Input written on (infinite) one sided tape.
- Special blank characters
- Finite state control
- Every step: Read character under head, write character out, move the head right or left (or stay).

<h5>Formal definition</h5>
  
A Turing machine is a 7-tuple(Q, $\Sigma ,\Gamma ,\delta  , q_{0}, q_{acc}, q_{rej}$)

- Q : Finite set of states
- $\Sigma$ : Finite input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ : Finite tape alphabet
- $\delta$ : Q x $\Gamma &rarr; Q$ x $\Gamma$ x {L, R, S\} : Transition function.
- $q_{0}$ $\in$ Q is the initial state
-  $q_{acc} \in$  Q is the accepting/final state
-  $q_{rej} \in$ Q is the rejecting state
-  \|\_\| or ? : Special blank symbol on the tape

<h5>Transition Function</h5>

 $\delta$ : Q x $\Gamma &rarr; Q$ x $\Gamma$ x {L, R, S\}

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec 8/Transition.png" alt="Concatenation" style="width: 420px;"> 
 
Can also be written as c &rarr; d, L

$\delta$ : (q, c) = (p, d, L)

- q : Current state.
- c : Character under tape head
- p : New state
- d : Character to write under tape head
- L : Move tape head left

<h5>Languages defined by a Turing Machine</h5>

- A language L is recursively enumerable if L is the set of strings accepted by some Turing Machine. L = {L(M) \| M some Turing machine}
- A language L is recursive (decidable) if L is the set of strings accepted by some Turing Machine that halts on every input. L = {L(M) \| M some Turing machine that halts on all inputs}.

<h4>Linear Bounded Automata</h4>

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec 8/Linear_Bounded.png" alt="Concatenation" style="width: 420px;"> 

- (Nondeterministic) Linear bounded automata can recognize all context sensitive languages.
- Machine can non-deterministically apply all production rule to input in reverse and see if we end up with the start token.
