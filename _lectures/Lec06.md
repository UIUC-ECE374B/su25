### Context Free Language
- CFL is a higher level language when compared to Regular Language.
- CFL is a language that can be generated by some **Context Free Grammar** and is a set of all languages that can be accepted by a **Push-down Automata**.
<br><br>


### Context Free Grammar
**Formal Definition**: Defined by 4 tuples *G = (V, T, P, S)*
- V = Finite set of Variables or Non-Terminal Symbols
- T = Finite set of Terminal Symbols
- S = Start symbol
- P = Finite set pf Production rules    
    - Each production rule is represented as A&rarr;$\alpha$
    - Where $\alpha$ is a string in $\{V \cup T\}^*$ and A $\in$ V
<br>


Example: For generating a language with equal number of 0s and 1s of the form $0^{n}1^{n}$. We will have the G = (\{S, A\}, \{0, 1\}, \{S&rarr;0A1, A&rarr;0A1 | $\varepsilon$\}, S)
- S&rarr;0A1 &emsp;&emsp;(using S&rarr;0A1)
-  &rarr;00A11 &emsp;&ensp;(using A&rarr;0A1)
-  &rarr;000A111 &ensp;(using A&rarr;0A1)
-  &rarr;000111 &emsp;&nbsp;(using A&rarr;$\varepsilon$\)

<br><br>

### Push-down Automata
- A machine that generates Context Free Grammar
- It is more powerful than a Finite State Machine and also has more memory
- PDA = FSM +  **Stack**
- Has 3 components:
    - Input
    - Finite Control Unit
    - Stack
<br><br>

**Formal Definition**: Defined by 6 tuples *P = (Q, $\Sigma$, $\Gamma$, $\delta$, s, A)*
- Q = finite set of states
- $\Sigma$ = finite set of input alphabets
- $\Gamma$ = finite set of stack alphabets
- s = start state
- A = set of accepting states
- $\delta$ = Transition Function


<b>Transition Function $\delta$ </b><br>
$\delta$ = $Q\times\Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\}\times\Gamma \cup \{\varepsilon\}$ &rarr; $P(Q \times (\Gamma\cup\{\varepsilon\}))$
- $\delta(q, a, X)$ &rarr; $(p, \gamma)$
- $q$ is a state in $Q$, $a$ is either an input in $\Sigma$ or $a=\varepsilon$, $X$ is a Stack symbol that ios part of $\Gamma$
- $p$ is a new state and $\gamma$ is string of stack symbols that replaces $X$ at the top of the stack
    - If $\gamma = \varepsilon$, then stack is popped
    - If $\gamma = X$, then stack is unchanged
    - If $\gamma = YZ$, then X is replaced by $Z$ and $Y$ is pushed into the stack

- $a$ = Input Symbol
- $b$ = Symbol on top of the stack which is pooped.
    - If $b=\varepsilon$, then stack is neither read or popped.
- $c$ = The Symbol that is pushed onto the stack
    - If $c=\varepsilon$, then nothing is pushed.


<br>
Example: Let's construct a PDA that accepts the language $L = \{0^n1^n | n\ge1\}$

#### **Closure Properties** of CFL
Given two CFG $G_1 = (V_1, T, P_1, S_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, T, P_2, S_2)$ and assume that $V_1 \cap V_2 = \phi$. Let $L1$ and $L2$ be languages produced by $G1$ and $G2$ respectively.
- CFLs are closed under *Union*. $L_1 \cup L_2$ is  a CFL.
- CFLs are closed under *Concatenation*. $L_1 . L_2$ is  a CFL.
- CFLs are closed under *Kleene star*. If $L$ is a CFL $\implies L^*$ is a CFL.
- CFLs are **not** closed under *Intersection*
- CFLs are **not** closed under *Complement*
