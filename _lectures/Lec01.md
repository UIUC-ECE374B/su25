#### Strings and Languages
- Strings are the elements of the languages. Each string represents a problem instance. 
- A alphabet($\Sigma$) is a finite set of symbols (example: $\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$).

Some string and set facts: 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
    Strings:
    <ul>
    <li>$x \cdot y = xy$ is the concatenation of two strings. </li>
    <li>$\vert w \vert$ is the length of a string </li>
    <li>$\Sigma^n$ is the set of all strings over $\Sigma$ of length $n$ </li>
    <li>$\Sigma^{*}$ is the set of all strings over $\Sigma$ of all lengths  </li>
    <li>$\varepsilon$ is the empty string </li>
    <li>Subsequence of string is a subset of its characters that appear in the same order as they do in the original string </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
    Sets:
    <ul>
    <li>$\emptyset$ is the empty set </li>
    <li>$\\{ \varepsilon \\}$ is the non-empty set containing one element, the empty string. </li>
    <li>Concatentation of two sets is all possible pairs of elements </li>
    </ul>
    </div>    
</div>

#### Terminology
- A *character*(a,b,c,x) is a unit of information represented by a symbol: letters, digits, whitespace
- A *alphabet*($\Sigma$)is a set of characters
- A *string*(w) is a sequence of characters
- A *language*(A,B,C,L) is a set of strings
- A grammar(G) is a set of rules that defines the strings that belong to a language

#### Regular Languages

**Kleene's Theorem:** A language is regular if and only if it can be obtained from finite languages by applying the three operations: union ($\cup$), concatenation ($\cdot$), repetition($^*$) a finite number of times. 

**Base Case:**: $\emptyset$, $\\{ \varepsilon \\}$, $\\{a\\}$ (for each $a \in \Sigma$) are all regular languages. 
**Inductive Step**: If you can apply the above operations on the base language a 

#### Regular expressions

A simple shorthand for describing a regular language. IN regular expressions: 

- $\emptyset$ denotes $\emptyset$
- $\varepsilon$ denotes $\\{\varepsilon\\}$
- $a$ denotes $\\{a\\}$
- $r_1+r_2$ denotes $R_1 \cup R_2$
- $r_1 \cdot r_2$ denotes $R_1R_2$
- $r^\*$ denotes $R^\*$


&nbsp;
#### Everything tied together

Let's look at the following problem: 

**Problem:** Consider the problem of a *n*-input *AND* function. The input ($x$) is a string $n$-digits long with $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ and has an output ($y$) which is the logical *AND* of all the elements of $x$.  

TO analyze it's computational complexity, we need to formulate it as a language  ($\Sigma = \\{0, 1, \cdot, \vert \\}$): 

$$ L_{AND_N} = 
		\begin{Bmatrix}
			0\cdot|0, & 1\cdot|1, & &  \\
			0 \cdot 0\cdot| 0, & 0 \cdot 1\cdot| 0, & 1 \cdot 0\cdot| 0, & 1 \cdot 1\cdot| 1 \\
			\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
			(0\cdot)^n|0, & (0\cdot)^{n-1}1|0, & \ldots & (1\cdot)^n|1 \ldots \\
		\end{Bmatrix} $$

Then to show it's one of the simplest languages there is, we represent that language as a regular expression:

$$r_{AND_N} = \underbrace{(0\cdot + 1\cdot)^* 0 (0\cdot + 1 \cdot)^* \vert 0"}_{\text{all output 0 instances}} + \overbrace{( 1 \cdot)^*\vert 1}^{\text{all output 1 instances}}$$

#### Things I forgot to mention

###### What is $\varepsilon^+$

There was a question on what $\varepsilon^+$ (and $\varepsilon^\*$). My argument was that it should be $\\{\varepsilon\\}$ because you always get a set out of the Kleene star and: 

$$\varepsilon^+ = \Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty}\varepsilon^n = \varepsilon^1 \cup \varepsilon^2 \cup \ldots$$

where you have multiple strings that you can union together. However, some of you were confused because theres only strings in that equation and so shouldn't the output be a string ($\varepsilon$ (not a set))? 

I went through a bunch of text and saw that Kleene star is always applied to a set. The only time when it isn't applied to a set is when we're talking about regular expressions. 

So I think you guys are right, sort of. Union is supposed to be a set operation and union-ing strings together means nothing. However, the issue is regular expressions are a permanent fixture of modern computability and so when someone writes $w^\*$, they don't literally mean union of $w$ with $ww$ and so on, *in the mathematical sense*, they mean $w^\*$ in the RegEx sense and regular expressions assume that when you write $w$, you mean $\\{w\\}$. So yeah, this is my bad. 

The correct answer would be $\\{\varepsilon\\}$ assuming a regular expression, or simply *undefined* in a strict mathematical interpretation.
