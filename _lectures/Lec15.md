<h4>Directed Acyclic Graph</h4>

<h5>Definition</h5>

A directed graph G is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) if there is no directed cycle in G.

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec16/DAG.png" alt="Concatenation" style=" height: 200px;width: 200px;"> 

- A vertex u is a source if it has no in-coming edges.
- A vertex u is a sink if it has no out-going edges.

<h5>Properties</h5>

- Every DAG G has at least one source and at least one sink
- G is a DAG if and only if $G^{rev}$ is a DAG
- G is a DAG if and only if each node is in its own strong connected component

<h4>Topological Ordering/Sorting</h4>

<h5>Definition</h5>

A topological ordering/topological sorting of G = (V, E) is an ordering $<$ on V such that if $(u &rarr; v) \in E $ then $u < v$ .

**Informal Definition** : One can order the vertices of the graph along a line (say the x-axis) such that all edges are from left to right.

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec16/Top.png" alt="Concatenation" style=" height: 250px;width: 300px;"> 

- A DAG G may have many different topological sorts
- A directed graph G can be topologically ordered if G is a DAG
- A directed graph G is a DAG if G can be topologically ordered

<h5>DFS with pre-post numbering in directed graphs</h5>

The Pre-visit number indicates when the node enters the DFS recursion stack, and the Post-visit number indicates when the node exits the DFS recursion stack. Pre and Post numbers can be used to determine whether a particular node is in the sub-tree of another node.

```
DFS(G)
    Mark all nodes u as unvisited
    T is set to ∅
    time = 0
    while there is an unvisited node u do
        DFS(u)
    Output T
```
```
DFS(u)
    Mark u as visited
    pre(u) = ++time
    for each edge (u, v) in Out(u) do
        if v is not visited
            add edge (u, v) to T
            DFS(v)
    post(u) = ++time
```

<h5>Properties</h5>

- Node u is active in time interval [pre(u), post(u)]
- DFS(G) takes O(m + n) time
- Edges added form a branching: a forest of out-trees
- For any two nodes u and v, the two intervals [pre(u), post(u)] and [pre(v), post(v)] are disjoint or one is contained in the other
- To find whether u lies in the sub-tree of v or not we just compare the pre and post number of u and v. If $pre[u] > pre[v]$ and $post[u] < post[v]$ then u lies in the sub-tree of v otherwise not.
- Output of DFS(G) depends on the order in which vertices are considered
- If u is the first vertex considered by DFS(G) then DFS(u) outputs a directed out-tree T rooted at u and a vertex v is in T if and only if $v ∈ rch(u)$

<h5>Example</h5>

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec16/prepostexample.png" alt="Concatenation" style=" height: 400px;width: 500px;"> 

Edges of G can be classified with respect to the DFS tree T as:

- Tree edges that belong to T
- A **forward edge** is a non-tree edges (x, y) such that y is a descendant of x i.e, $pre(x) < pre(y) < post(y) < post(x)$.
- A **backward edge** is a non-tree edge (x, y) such that y is an ancestor of x.
- A **cross edge** is a non-tree edges (x, y) such that they don’t have a ancestor/descendant relationship between them.

**Cycle detection in directed graph using topological sorting**

Given a graph G, if it is a Directed Acyclic graph then compute a topological sort. If it failes, then output the cycle C.

The algorithm will be as follows:
- Compute DFS(G)
- If there is a back edge e = (v, u) then G is not a DAG. Output cycle C formed by path from u to v in T plus edge (v, u).
- Otherwise output nodes in decreasing post-visit order.

 The above algorithm runs in $O(n + m)$ time.

 <h4>Graph of strong connected components</h4>

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec16/meta.png" alt="Concatenation" style=" height: 200px;width: 500px;"> 

Let $S_1, S_2, . . . S_k$ be the strong connected components (i.e.,SCCs) of G. The graph of SCCs is $G^{SCC}$. It is created by collapsing every strong connected component to a single vertex.
- Vertices are $S_1, S_2, . . . S_k$
- There is an edge $(S_i, S_j)$ if there is some $u \in S_i$ and $v \in S_j$ such that (u, v) is an edge in G

For a directed graph G, its meta-graph $G^{SCC}$ is a DAG.

The straightforward algorithm(discussed in Lecture 15) to find all SCCs of a given directed graph has a running time of $O(n(n + m))$.

The Linear time Algorithm for SCCs will be as follows:
- Let u be a vertex in a sink SCC of $G^{SCC}$
- Do DFS(u) to compute SCC(u)
- Remove SCC(u) and repeat

If v is the vertex with maximum post numbering in $DFS(G^{rev})$. Then v is in a SCC S, such that S is a sink of $G^{SCC}$. So, we can find a vertex in a sink SCC of $G^{SCC}$ for the linear time algorithm. Let us assume $G1=G^{rev}$.

```
do DFS(G1) and output vertices in decreasing post order.
Mark all nodes as unvisited
for each u in the computed order do
    if u is not visited then
        DFS(u)
        Let S1 be the nodes reached by u
        Output S1 as a strong connected component
        Remove S1 from G
```



The above algorithm  runs in time $O(m + n)$ and correctly outputs all the SCCs of G.
