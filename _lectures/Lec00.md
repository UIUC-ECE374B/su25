#### Big Questions

This course is focused on answering three big questions: 

- Given infinite time, how can we group problems by their "complexity" (Computability-theory)
- Given finite time, but a problem we know is computable, how fast can we solve the problem (Algorithmic design)
- Given a problem which is difficult to solve, can we infer how slow/fast we can solve it by comparing it to other known problems (Reductions)

#### Two types of complexity

| Computational Complexity      | Algorithmic Complexity |
| -----------                   | -----------            |

#### Why Languages? 
Problems need to be represented as languages to be comparable. A language is a set of strings and each string represents and *instance* of the problem (a specific set of inputs and their corresponding output). For example, the problem of adding two numbers together can be represented by the language: 

**Problem:** Multiplying two integers together               

**Language:** 
$$L_{MULT2} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \times 1|1, & 1 \times 2|2, & 1 \times 3|3, \ldots\\
  2 \times 1|2, & 2 \times 2|4, & 2 \times 3|6, \ldots \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  n \times 1|n, & n \times 2|2n, & n \times 3|3n, \ldots \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
