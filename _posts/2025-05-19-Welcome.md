Welcome to the ECE374-B website for the Summer 2025 semester. During the summer, this course is offered both in-person and online. It is always under construction and will be progressively populated as the semester goes on so make sure to check back often and  and still being populated. I'm sure there are many typos and such. If you see any errors please submit a issue in the website's [github repo](https://github.com/UIUC-ECE374B-FA23/UIUC-ECE374B-FA23.github.io)! Raising issues improves the course site, ups your GitHub participation stats and will be rewarded in other ways as well!
