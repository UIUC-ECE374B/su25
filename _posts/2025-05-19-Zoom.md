For the summer session, we will be holding in-person sessions in ECEB-2015 with an option to join over [Zoom](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/82104976464?pwd=3X2ZvkEa3Qh6gLXX5fa0pBn6EG9mlW.1). I will give more information about the structure in the first day of the course but the general expectation is that you view the lectures asynchrnously and we go through the discussions together synchronously. However, for the first week, the labs are very condusive to self study and I want to make sure most of you have the theory on lock so I will be doing lectures. We will begin on May 20th so please come in with your questions!
